      <h2>Why Clean Water Matters</h2>
      <p>Access to safe water saves lives. Millions still suffer from preventable diseases caused by unsafe water.
        Together, we can make a difference.

        Access to clean water and sanitation is fundamental to human dignity, health, and development.

        Health Impact: Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and
        typhoid.
        In Uganda alone, diarrheal diseases kill dozens of children daily.

        Gender Equity: Women and girls are disproportionately affected, especially in areas without private sanitation
        facilities.</p>

      <p>ðŸ“Š Current Challenges
        Global Statistics:

        2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water.

        3.4 billion lack safely managed sanitation.

        1.7 billion lack basic hygiene services.

        Water Scarcity: Climate change and population growth are intensifying water stress in many regions.

        Open Defecation: Still practiced by millions, contributing to disease and environmental degradation.

        ðŸš€ Solutions and Strategies
        Infrastructure Investment: Building sustainable water systems and sanitation facilities, especially in rural and
        underserved areas.

        Hygiene Education: Promoting handwashing and safe hygiene practices is essential for health improvements.

        Community-Led Initiatives: Programs like Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) empower local populations to take
        ownership of sanitation improvements.

        Technology and Innovation: Water harvesting, desalination, and wastewater recycling are key tools for future
        resilience.</p>

      <p>
        ðŸŒ± Local Action Ideas
        Organize a river or lake cleanup.

        Start a hygiene awareness campaign in your school or neighborhood.

        Advocate for better sanitation facilities in local schools and clinics.

        Reduce personal water wasteâ€”shorter showers, fixing leaks, and using water-efficient appliances.</p>

      <h2>Helping people bring water, sanitation, and hygiene to their communities</h2>
      <h2>WATER</h2>
      <p>Our teams constructs piped water supply systems in local areas, and uses a Water as a Business model to make
        sure
        water services are sustainable. This type of model uses the private sector to manage water systems, and the
        approach
        creates jobs for water point mechanics, private entrepreneurs, and water kiosk and hand pump attendants. We help
        train these entrepreneurs to manage and repair water systems.</p>

      <p>Our team invent and test new sanitation products and technologies that are designed to meet Ugandan communities
        sanitation needs. We also support sanitation businesses like masons and pit latrine emptiers, connecting them to
        new
        Sanitation Hub technologies and providing them with business support.</p>

      <p>Our team trains teachers and school health clubs on proper water, sanitation, and hygiene practices, as well as
        menstrual hygiene management. We have also begun installing rainwater catchment systems in schools for water
        reuse.
